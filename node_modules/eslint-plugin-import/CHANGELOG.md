## [Unreleased]


## [2.0.1] - 2016-10-06
### Fixed
- Fixed code that relied on removed dependencies. ([#604])

## [2.0.0]! - 2016-09-30
### Added
- [`unambiguous`] rule: report modules that are not unambiguously ES modules.
- `recommended` shared config. Roughly `errors` and `warnings` mixed together,
  with some `parserOptions` in the mix. ([#402])
- `react` shared config: added `jsx: true` to `parserOptions.ecmaFeatures`.
- Added [`no-webpack-loader-syntax`] rule: forbid custom Webpack loader syntax in imports. ([#586], thanks [@fson]!)
- Add option `newlines-between: "ignore"` to [`order`] ([#519])
- Added [`no-unassigned-import`] rule ([#529])

### Breaking
- [`import/extensions` setting] defaults to `['.js']`. ([#306])
- [`import/ignore` setting] defaults to nothing, and ambiguous modules are ignored natively. This means importing from CommonJS modules will no longer be reported by [`default`], [`named`], or [`namespace`], regardless of `import/ignore`. ([#270])
- [`newline-after-import`]: Removed need for an empty line after an inline `require` call ([#570])
- [`order`]: Default value for `newlines-between` option is now `ignore` ([#519])

### Changed
- `imports-first` is renamed to [`first`]. `imports-first` alias will continue to
  exist, but may be removed in a future major release.
- Case-sensitivity: now specifically (and optionally) reported by [`no-unresolved`].
  Other rules will ignore case-mismatches on paths on case-insensitive filesystems. ([#311])

### Fixed
- [`no-internal-modules`]: support `@`-scoped packages ([#577]+[#578], thanks [@spalger])

## [1.16.0] - 2016-09-22
### Added
- Added [`no-dynamic-require`] rule: forbid `require()` calls with expressions. ([#567], [#568])
- Added [`no-internal-modules`] rule: restrict deep package imports to specific folders. ([#485], thanks [@spalger]!)
- [`extensions`]: allow override of a chosen default with options object ([#555], thanks [@ljharb]!)

### Fixed
- [`no-named-as-default`] no longer false-positives on `export default from '...'` ([#566], thanks [@preco21])
- [`default`]: allow re-export of values from ignored files as default ([#545], thanks [@skyrpex])

## [1.15.0] - 2016-09-12
### Added
- Added an `allow` option to [`no-nodejs-modules`] to allow exceptions ([#452], [#509]).
- Added [`no-absolute-path`] rule ([#530], [#538])
- [`max-dependencies`] for specifying the maximum number of dependencies (both `import` and `require`) a module can have. (see [#489], thanks [@tizmagik])
- Added glob option to config for [`no-extraneous-dependencies`], after much bikeshedding. Thanks, [@knpwrs]! ([#527])

### Fixed
- [`no-named-as-default-member`] Allow default import to have a property named "default" ([#507], [#508], thanks [@jquense] for both!)

## [1.14.0] - 2016-08-22
### Added
- [`import/parsers` setting]: parse some dependencies (i.e. TypeScript!) with a different parser than the ESLint-configured parser. ([#503])

### Fixed
- [`namespace`] exception for get property from `namespace` import, which are re-export from commonjs module ([#499] fixes [#416], thanks [@wKich])

## [1.13.0] - 2016-08-11
### Added
- `allowComputed` option for [`namespace`] rule. If set to `true`, won't report
  computed member references to namespaces. (see [#456])

### Changed
- Modified [`no-nodejs-modules`] error message to include the
